# @voxpelli/eslint-config

[![js-semistandard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-semistandard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/standard/semistandard)

My personal ESLint config which extends [standard](https://standardjs.com/) / [semistandard](https://github.com/standard/semistandard) with a couple of extra checks that I find helpful in my projects.

Includes the semistandard rules directly rather than relying on [eslint-config-semistandard](https://github.com/standard/eslint-config-semistandard), as that package isn't always trailing the main [eslint-config-standard](https://github.com/standard/eslint-config-standard) package.

This package follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Tightening of any checks is a breaking change, therefore that will only happen in major releases. Minor and patch releases will only include relaxation of rules or fixing of minor obvious oversights.

## Can I use this in my own project?

Absolutely, go ahead! I maintain this project as if multiple people are using it. Be sure to give me feedback and if you like it, give me a ping and say so, would make my day ðŸ˜„

## Installation

Be sure to install versions of peer dependencies that are valid according to the peer dependency specification of this module.

As ESLint configs and dependencies can and will change their rules with major releases you will likely get an incorrect ruleset otherwise.

To easily install all correct peer dependencies, you can use [`install-peerdeps`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/install-peerdeps):

```bash
install-peerdeps --dev @voxpelli/eslint-config
```

Then add a `.eslintrc` with the following:

```
{
  "extends": "@voxpelli",
  "root": true
}
```

## How does this differ from pure [standard](https://standardjs.com/)?

### :wrench: Changed [standard](https://standardjs.com/) rules

* :wrench::warning: [`comma-dangle`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/comma-dangle) â€“ *changed* â€“ ignore it in everything but functions + is it set to `warn` rather than `error`. Reason: I'm moving towards preferring dangling commas and thus want my shared config to not prohibit them while a project-by-project override can actually require them (Incompatible with standard :warning:)
* :wrench: [`no-multi-spaces`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-multi-spaces) â€“ *changed* â€“ sets `ignoreEOLComments` to `true`, can be useful for more readable comments across multiple lines and I see no real downsides to it (Incompatible with standard :warning:)
* :wrench: [`no-unused-vars`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-unused-vars) â€“ *changed* â€“ sets `"args": "all", "argsIgnorePattern": "^_",` because I personally don't feel limited by [Express error handlers](https://github.com/standard/standard/issues/419#issuecomment-718186130) + wants to stay in sync with TypeScript `noUnusedParameters`
* :wrench: [`semi`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/semi) and [`no-extra-semi`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-extra-semi) â€“ *changed* â€“ adopts the semicolons setup from [semistandard](https://github.com/standard/semistandard)  (Incompatible with plain standard :warning:, compatible with semistandard)
* :wrench::warning: [`node/no-deprecated-api`](https://github.com/mysticatea/eslint-plugin-node/blob/master/docs/rules/no-deprecated-api.md) â€“ *changed* â€“ changed to `warn` instead of `error` as often it's not an urgent thing to fix

### :heavy_plus_sign: Added ESLint core rules

* :warning: [`func-style`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/func-style) â€“ disallows function declarations, good to be consistent with how functions are declared
* :warning: [`no-console`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-console) â€“ warns on existence of `console.log` and similar, as they are mostly used for debugging and should not be committed
* :stop_sign: [`no-nonoctal-decimal-escape`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-nonoctal-decimal-escape) â€“ there's no reason not to ban it
* :stop_sign: [`no-unsafe-optional-chaining`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-unsafe-optional-chaining) â€“ enforces one to be careful with `.?` and not use it in ways that can inadvertently cause errors or `NaN` results
* :warning: [`no-warning-comments`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-warning-comments) â€“ warns of the existence of `FIXME` comments, as they should always be fixed before pushing
* :stop_sign: [`object-shorthand`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/object-shorthand) â€“ requires the use of object shorthands for properties, more tidy
* :stop_sign: [`quote-props`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/quote-props) â€“ requires properties to be quoted when needed but otherwise disallows it

### :package: Added ESLint rule package

* [`plugin:node/recommended`](https://github.com/mysticatea/eslint-plugin-node#-rules)
* [`plugin:security/recommended`](https://github.com/nodesecurity/eslint-plugin-security/blob/master/index.js)
* [`plugin:mocha/recommended`](https://github.com/lo1tuma/eslint-plugin-mocha/blob/master/index.js)
* [`plugin:unicorn/recommended`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn/blob/master/index.js)
* [`plugin:promise/recommended`](https://github.com/xjamundx/eslint-plugin-promise/blob/development/index.js)
* [`@voxpelli/eslint-config-jsdoc-ts`](https://github.com/voxpelli/eslint-config-jsdoc-ts/blob/main/eslintrc.json) â€“ which is a TypeScript packaging of [`plugin:jsdoc/recommended`](https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc#configuration)

#### :wrench: Overrides of added ESLint rule packages

* :mute: [`no-process-exit`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-process-exit) â€“ *deactivated* â€“ added by `plugin:node/recommended`, but deactivated in favor of [`unicorn/no-process-exit`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn/blob/master/docs/rules/no-process-exit.md)

* :mute: [`mocha/no-mocha-arrows`](https://github.com/lo1tuma/eslint-plugin-mocha/blob/master/docs/rules/no-mocha-arrows.md) â€“ *deactivated* â€“ while [Mocha discourages arrow functions](https://mochajs.org/#arrow-functions) I find it more readable to use them + I find it safe when type checking ones test files as then the type checking will notify one when one tries to do a `this.setTimeout()` or similar in an arrow function where there is no such local context

* :mute: [`security/detect-object-injection`](https://github.com/nodesecurity/eslint-plugin-security#detect-object-injection) â€“ *deactivated* â€“ causes too many false errors
* :mute: [`security/detect-unsafe-regex`](https://github.com/nodesecurity/eslint-plugin-security#detect-unsafe-regex) â€“ *deactivated* â€“ at least early on wasn't very stable

* :wrench: [`unicorn/catch-error-name`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn/blob/master/docs/rules/catch-error-name.md) â€“ *changed* â€“ I prefer `err` over `error` as I find `error`to be a far too similar name to the built in `Error` class
* :mute: [`unicorn/explicit-length-check`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn/blob/master/docs/rules/explicit-length-check.md) â€“ *deactivated* â€“ I don't see an issue with `if (string.length)` instead of `if (string.length !== 0)`
* :warning: [`unicorn/prefer-add-event-listener`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn/blob/master/docs/rules/prefer-add-event-listener.md) â€“ *changed* â€“ set to `warn` instead of `error`
* :mute: [`unicorn/prefer-module`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn/blob/master/docs/rules/prefer-module.md) â€“ *changed* â€“ deactivated, each project needs to activate this one themselves for now
* :warning: [`unicorn/prefer-spread`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn/blob/master/docs/rules/prefer-spread.md) â€“ *changed* â€“ set to `warn` instead of `error`
* :mute: [`unicorn/prevent-abbreviations`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn/blob/master/docs/rules/prevent-abbreviations.md) â€“ *deactivated* â€“ same as `unicorn/catch-error-name`, I prefer an abbreviated `err` over a non-abbreviated `error`because the latter is too similar to `Error` for my taste

### :heavy_plus_sign: Additional standalone ESLint rules

<!-- TODO: Maybe add promise/prefer-await-to-callbacks -->
<!-- TODO: Maybe add node/no-mixed-requires -->

* :warning: [`es/no-exponential-operators`](https://mysticatea.github.io/eslint-plugin-es/rules/no-exponential-operators.html) â€“ disallows the use of the `**` operator, as that's in most cases a mistake and one really meant to write `*`

* :warning: [`node/prefer-global/console`](https://github.com/mysticatea/eslint-plugin-node/blob/master/docs/rules/prefer-global/console.md)
* :warning: [`node/prefer-promises/fs`](https://github.com/mysticatea/eslint-plugin-node/blob/master/docs/rules/prefer-promises/fs.md)
* :warning: [`node/no-process-env`](https://github.com/mysticatea/eslint-plugin-node/blob/master/docs/rules/no-process-env.md)
* :stop_sign: [`node/no-sync`](https://github.com/mysticatea/eslint-plugin-node/blob/master/docs/rules/no-sync.md)

* :stop_sign: [`promise/prefer-await-to-then`](https://github.com/xjamundx/eslint-plugin-promise/blob/development/docs/rules/prefer-await-to-then.md)
